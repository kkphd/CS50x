## Objective
Neuropsychologists who accept insurance must submit superbills (an itemized form containing patient visit information) to Medicare and insurance companies to receive payment for services. This web-based application is a simple calculator for determining the appropriate units for technician-provided assessment services, which is perhaps the most popular or most preferred method of completing testing.

## Project Description
The current project was inspired by problems I encountered in my professional career, namely a desire for increased efficiency in calculating units for insurance billing while working in a clinical service line. This calculator reflects select Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (specifically 96138, 96139, and 96146), which were updated on January 1, 2019 by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

This application is highly convenient for neuropsychology services that have multiple technicians, providers, or staff, as it can be used from any location and for any client. **Neither patient health information nor user registration are required for use.**

For more information about billing codes, consult the [CMS website](https://www.cms.gov/).

## Featured Deliverable
